# Project-II-Webscraper
This is a simple project that I've made using Python, BeautifulSoup, Selenium and PyQt5. <br>
It was built for a small company that required some specific data to be scraped and converted to excel file. <br>
They are using 3rd party company to provide training for their staff. Getting all the training data and filtering it out by hand is time consuming, so
they needed a simple tool to do that automatically. <br>
In the future this project might grow to have more functions; I might use it to practice using PyQt5 or use sqlite to hold on to data.
